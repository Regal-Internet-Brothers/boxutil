boxutil
=======

## Description
A simple module for the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey) containing useful routines for dealing with the standard ['monkey.boxes'](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey/blob/develop/modules/monkey/boxes.monkey) module.

## Installation
This module is officially available from the [Regal Modules](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/regal-modules#regal-modules) project, and may be installed by following the installation guide provided with that repository.

Although this can be installed with the Regal Modules, this particular module aims to be as dependency free as possible. This means the only requirements this module has are covered by the ["standard library"](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey/tree/develop/modules) provided with Monkey. This means this module may be used as a completely separate entity, without being tied to '[regal](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/regal-modules)'.

Import syntax varies with usage, with the official distribution using 'regal' as a parent namespace. (e.g. regal.boxutil)
